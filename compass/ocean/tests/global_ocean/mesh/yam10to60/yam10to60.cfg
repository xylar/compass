mesh_description = Yet Another Mesh (YAM) is regionally refined around the Amazon
                   River delta.  It is used in E3SM version ${e3sm_version} for
                   studies of blah, blah.  It has Enhanced resolution (${min_res} km)
                   around the Amazon delta, 20-km resolution in the northern South
                   Atlantic, 35-km resolution at the poles, 60-km at mid
                   latitudes, and 30-km at the equator.  This mesh has <<<levels>>>
